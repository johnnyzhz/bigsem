# BigSEM online app

BigSEM can be used either locally as R packages or online using our web app.

Both R packages, [networksem](/docs/networksem) and [TextSEM](/docs/textsem) can be used online within a web browser.

To use our web app, go to the website at [https://bigsem.psychstat.org/app](https://bigsem.psychstat.org/app). Note that you will be prompted to log in as a user. If you don't have an account, you can register one for free.

Once logging in our web app, one can create a project and start to conduct the analysis. Note that we manage projects as files. One can upload, create, and delete files within the app.
