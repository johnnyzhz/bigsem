# The developer's Manual

This is the developer manual of BigSEM for those who want to contribute to the development of BigSEM program. If you only intend to use BigSEM, please check out the user's manual using the links on the left.

We have developed two R packages - networksem for SEM analysis with network data, and TextSEM for SEM analysis with text data. The source codes of both packages can be found on Githhub now.

- networksem: [https://github.com/iasnobmatsu/networksem](https://github.com/iasnobmatsu/networksem)
- TextSEM: [https://github.com/Stan7s/TextSEM](https://github.com/Stan7s/TextSEM)

We welcome anyone to contribute to the development of the packages. One can push the changes to the packages directly.
