# Manuals for networksem and TextSEM

- [R package networksem](docs/networksem)
- [R package TextSEM](docs/textsem)

BigSEM can be used either locally as R packages or online using our web app.

## R Package

We have two R packages in the development stage that can now be installed from GitHub. The packages will be available on CRAN soon. The R package networksem can be used for SEM network analysis and the package TextSEM can be used for text analysis.

```
## Install the package for network analysis
remotes::install_github("iasnobmatsu/networksem")

## Install the package for text analysis
remotes::install_github("Stan7s/TextSEM")
```

## Web App

To use our web app, go to the website at [https://bigsem.psychstat.org/app](https://bigsem.psychstat.org/app). Note that you will be prompted to log in as a user. If you don't have an account, you can register one for free.

Once logging in our web app, one can create a project and start to conduct the analysis. Note that we manage projects as files. One can upload, create, and delete files within the app.
