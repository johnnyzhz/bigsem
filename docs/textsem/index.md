# Manual for the R package TextSEM

Text data is increasingly recognized as a rich source of information, offering insights that traditional quantitative measures may overlook. Modern natural language processing (NLP) offers a variety of techniques for analyzing text, such as sentiment analysis (Wankhade et al., 2022), topic modeling (Vayansky & Kumar, 2020), and word embedding (Wang et al., 2019). These techniques automatically extract information from text and transform it into meaningful values or vectors, by-passing the need for labor-intensive manual coding.

Structural equation modeling (SEM) is a popular tool in the social and behavioral sciences for analyzing relationships between observed and latent variables. Incorporating textual data into SEM provides a promising avenue for researchers to integrate qualitative and quantitative data analysis. In response to this opportunity, we developed TextSEM, an R package designed to incorporate text data within SEM frameworks. This package leverages advanced NLP techniques to convert text into quantitative variables, integrate them into SEM model, and conduct estimation.

Here, we demonstrate the practical application of TextSEM through examples using a teaching evaluation dataset.
